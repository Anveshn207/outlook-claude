# Kurweball — Context Summary

## Session Summary
- **Date**: 2026-02-11
- **Project**: Kurweball — Unified Recruiting Platform (ATS + CRM + Airtable-lite)
- **Location**: `C:\Outlook Claude\Kurweball`

### Accomplished (Sprint 1 — COMPLETE)
- Initialized monorepo (npm workspaces + Turborepo) with root configs
- Scaffolded NestJS API (`apps/api`) with full auth module (JWT login/register/refresh/me)
- Scaffolded Next.js 15 frontend (`apps/web`) with Tailwind v4 + shadcn/ui components
- Created shared types package (`packages/shared`) with all entity types + constants
- Wrote full Prisma schema: 18 models, 13 enums
- Built app shell: dark sidebar, navbar, 8 dashboard pages
- Created seed script with realistic demo data
- Installed PostgreSQL 16, ran Prisma migration, seeded database

### Accomplished (Sprint 2 — COMPLETE)
- Built 3 CRUD API modules: Candidates (6 files), Jobs (6 files), Clients+Contacts (8 files)
- All tenant-scoped via JWT, with pagination, search, filtering, sorting
- Built reusable DataTable component with server-side pagination/sort/search
- Created 5 new UI primitives: Table, Select, Dialog, Label, Textarea
- Wired all frontend pages (candidates, jobs, clients, dashboard) to real API data
- Added create dialogs for candidates, jobs, clients
- Dashboard shows real counts from API

### In Progress
- Nothing partially done — Sprint 2 is 100% complete

### Next Steps (Sprint 3: Pipeline + Submissions)
1. Submissions: Submit candidate to job, status tracking
2. Pipeline Kanban: Drag-and-drop board (stages as columns, submissions as cards)
3. Pipeline Templates: Configure stages in Settings
4. Stage History: Track movement through pipeline with timestamps
5. Interviews: Schedule, track feedback, status
6. Candidate Profile: Unified view (info, resumes, submissions, activities)

### Key Decisions
- **API response format**: `{ data: T[], meta: { total, page, limit, totalPages } }`
- **DataTable component**: Generic with column config, server-side everything
- **Create forms**: Dialog-based (not separate pages)
- All CRUD modules follow same pattern: module, service, controller, 3 DTOs

### Bugs/Issues
- None currently

## Resume Instructions
1. Read this file first
2. Read memory: `C:\Users\E2 Training\.claude\projects\C--Outlook-Claude\memory\kurweball-progress.md`
3. Read the plan: `C:\Users\E2 Training\.claude\plans\mighty-pondering-sketch.md`
4. Verify services: `curl http://localhost:3000` (frontend) and `curl -X POST http://localhost:3001/api/auth/login -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"email":"admin@acme.com","password":"password123"}'` (API)
