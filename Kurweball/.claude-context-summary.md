# KurweBall — Context Summary

## Session Summary
- **Date**: 2026-02-19
- **Project**: KurweBall — Unified Recruiting Platform (ATS + CRM)
- **Location**: `C:\Outlook Claude\Kurweball`
- **Branch**: master

### Accomplished This Session
1. **Bench Sales Module — Full CRUD** (from previous session, carried over)
2. **Add Record Dialog** — Manual data entry form with all 34 fields in 2-column grid, Consultant required
3. **View/Edit Record Dialog** — Click any table row to open detail view showing all populated fields. Footer has Delete (red), Edit, Close buttons. Edit mode switches to editable form. Empty fields hidden in view mode.
4. **Horizontal Scrolling Fix** — Fixed table not scrolling when all 34 columns enabled:
   - Root cause: Flex items in app-shell had default `min-width: auto` preventing shrink below content width
   - Fix: Added `min-w-0` to `<div className="flex flex-1 flex-col">` and `<main>` in `app-shell.tsx`
   - Added `overflow-x-hidden` to `<main>` element
   - Changed table from `<Table>` component (which wraps in extra `overflow-auto` div) to raw `<table className="w-max min-w-full">`
   - Added `overflow-hidden` to the Card wrapper, `overflow-x-auto` on scroll container
5. **Test Record** — Created "Rajesh Kumar" test record (still in DB — user was about to delete it)

### Key Files Modified This Session
- `apps/web/src/app/(dashboard)/bench-sales/page.tsx` — Added: viewRecord/editing/editData/saving state, openRecord(), startEditing(), handleSave(), handleDelete() functions, View/Edit Dialog with read-only and edit modes, clickable table rows with cursor-pointer, stopPropagation on checkbox cell. Changed Table to raw `<table>` for scroll fix.
- `apps/web/src/components/layout/app-shell.tsx` — Added `min-w-0` to flex wrapper div and `min-w-0 overflow-x-hidden` to `<main>` element (line 42 and 45)

### What Needs To Be Done Next
1. Delete the test "Rajesh Kumar" record (user was about to do this)
2. Clean up temp files (seed-bench-sales.ts, filter-bench.js, create-bench-excel.js, screenshot-*.png)
3. Update candidate detail/edit pages for new fields (applicantId, state, dateOfBirth, resumeAvailable)
4. Add bench sales export functionality
5. Deploy to Hetzner (65.108.218.222 — SSH port firewalled)
